## Download latest changes to a Branch from github.com

1. Make sure you are on the branch you want to pull from
2. Confirm that Typora is closed
3. Select *Fetch origin*

Issue discovered with this. While fetching changes from origin, GitHub Desktop refuses to fetch from github.com for as long as Typora is open. This is quite awkward. But might be manageable as this will mostly only matter when someone has been working from multiple computers.

2. Open GitHub Desktop
3. Select desired file
4. View changes in preview window

These changes are also viewable on github.com when making a pull request.
