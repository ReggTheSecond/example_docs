# Project Structure

*Page object models will use calabash model for example.*

- project folder
  - source
  - project documents
    - features
      - requirements.feature
    - step_definations
      - page_object_models
        - home_screen_page.rb
        - menu_screen_page.rb
      - test_implementation.rb

Should requirements be viewable from the same editor? Typora cannot open .feature files.

Having Typroa open with the repository folder structure open can cause issues committing files changed in another program. Did not reproduce.
